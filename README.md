**Booting**

Booting is the process of starting up a computer and loading the operating system (OS) into the computer's memory so that it can be used. When you turn on a computer, it performs a series of steps to prepare the hardware and software for use.

**Types of Booting**

1.Cold Booting (Hard Booting)

This happens when you turn on the computer from a completely powered-off state. Examples include Linux and MacOS.

2.Warm Booting (Soft Booting)

This happens when you restart the computer without turning off the power completely. Examples include Windows.

## 2nd day of training

In today's class, we learnt about:

**Kernel**

The kernel is the core part of an operating system. It acts as a bridge between the computer hardware and the software applications. The kernel manages system resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, ensuring that programs run smoothly and efficiently.

![alt text](shell.png)

**Shell**

The shell is a user interface that allows you to interact with the operating system. It takes commands from the user and tells the OS what to do.

**Types of Shells**

bash: Enhanced sh with more features, widely used on Linux.

sh: Basic Unix shell, mainly for scripting and compatibility.

zsh: Feature-rich, highly customizable shell popular among power users.

fish: User-friendly shell with smart features and easy syntax.

**Categories of Shells:**

- Command-Line Shell: You type text commands (like in Windows Command Prompt or Linux Terminal).
- Graphical Shell: You use graphical elements like icons and menus (like Windows Explorer or macOS Finder).

**File System Structure (/, /home, /etc, /var etc)**

The root directory, represented by a single slash /, is the top-level directory of the entire Linux file system hierarchy. All files and directories branch out from this root directory.

![alt text](image.jpg)

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/`       | Root directory â€“ the top of the file system |
| `/bin`    | Essential binary commands |
| `/boot`   | Boot loader files, including the Linux kernel |
| `/dev`    | Device files |
| `/etc`    | Configuration files for the system and applications |
| `/home`   | User home directories |
| `/lib`    | Shared libraries needed by programs in bin and sbin |
| `/media`  | Mount point for removable media |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount point for filesystems |
| `/opt`    | Optional software and third-party applications |
| `/proc`   | Virtual filesystem for system information (kernel, processes) |
| `/root`   | Home directory for the root user |
| `/run`    | Runtime data for processes |
| `/sbin`   | System administration binaries |
| `/srv`    | Data for services like FTP, web servers |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files (cleared on reboot) |
| `/usr`    | User applications and files |
| `/var`    | Variable data |

**Commands**

| Advanced Features | More enterprise tools                | Basic features                       |

**Dual boot**

Dual boot means installing two operating systems (OSes) on the same computer, so you can choose which one to use when the computer starts.

**Partitioning Schemes**

**MBR**

MBR (Master Boot Record) is an older partitioning system used on hard drives.
- Works on most old computers (BIOS systems).
- Can have up to 4 primary partitions.
- Supports drives up to 2 TB only.
  
**GPT**

GPT (GUID Partition Table) is a newer and better partitioning system used with modern computers.
- Supports more than 100 partitions.
- Works with large hard drives (over 2 TB).
- Stores multiple copies of data for safety.

**ISO**

An ISO file (or ISO image) is a copy of an entire CD, DVD, or installation disc saved as a single file. It's often used to distribute operating systems or software.

**FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS**

Permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.

ðŸ”¹**chmod**

chmod stands for change mode â€” it changes file or directory permissions.

Syntax: chmod +x filename.sh

**+x** changes the file to executable

![alt text](chmod.png)

ðŸ”¹**chmod 444**

It sets the permissions of a file or directory to read-only for everyone:

- Owner, Group, and Others can only read the file.
- No one can modify (write) or run (execute) it.

Syntax: chmod 444 filename.sh

![alt text](wchmod444.png)

![alt text](chmod444.png)

ðŸ”¹**chmod 644**

Gives permission only to the owner.

It sets the file permissions so that:

- The owner can read and write the file.
- The group and others can only read the file.
- No one has execute permission.
  
Syntax: chmod 644 filename.sh

![alt text](wchmod644.png)

![alt text](chmod644.png)

**ECHO**

echo is a command used to display text or variables to the screen or redirect them elsewhere (like into a file). It's available in Linux, Unix, Windows CMD, and many programming languages. It can be used for creating a file.

Syntax - echo text > filename.txt

![alt text](echo.png)

**REDIRECTION**

Redirection is the process of changing the flow of input or output in computing. It tells a system to send data somewhere else instead of using the default path.

Redirection lets you:

- Take input from a file instead of typing it.
- Send output to a file instead of the screen.
- Save error messages separately.

**Types of Redirection**

1. Standard Output Redirection (>)

Purpose: Sends output to a file (overwrites if it exists).

Example:

ls > files.txt

Saves output of ls to files.txt.

2. Append Output (>>)
    
Purpose: Sends output to a file without overwriting.

Example:

echo "New line" >> notes.txt

3. Standard Input Redirection (<)

Purpose: Takes input from a file instead of keyboard.

Example:

sort < names.txt

Sorts the contents of names.txt.

**PIPES**

Pipes (|) in Linux are used to connect the output of one command directly into the input of another â€” creating powerful command chains.

**Basic Syntax**

command1 | command2

- command1 â†’ produces output
- command2 â†’ takes that output as input

**How Pipes Work**

Behind the scenes:

- Each command runs in its own process.
- The stdout (standard output) of the first command is connected to the stdin (standard input) of the next command.

![alt text](pipe.png)

ðŸ”¸**Wildcards**

Wildcards let you match filenames or strings with patterns. They're often used with commands like ls, cp, mv, and rm.

Examples - *.sh, file?.txt

| Wildcard | Meaning                      | Example                      |
|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters | `*.txt` matches all `.txt` files |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character | `file?.txt` matches `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt` |
| `[abc]`  | Matches one character listed  | `file[123].txt` matches `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, or `file3.txt` |

**FILE COMPRESSION**

File compression is the process of reducing the size of a file by encoding its data more efficiently. This helps save disk space and makes it faster to transfer files over networks.

**How It Works:**

- Removing Redundancy: Compression algorithms look for patterns or repeated data in the file and represent them in a shorter way.
- Encoding Data: Instead of storing repeated data multiple times, the algorithm stores it once and uses references, codes, or symbols to represent repeated parts.

| Command                 | Syntax                     | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compress file           | `gzip file.txt`             | Compress `file.txt` â†’ creates `file.txt.gz`                      |
| Decompress file         | `gunzip file.txt.gz`        | Decompress `file.txt.gz` â†’ restores `file.txt`                   |
| Compress & keep original| `gzip -k file.txt`          | Compress but **keep** original file                              |

**ASSIGNMENT**

**chown**

The chown command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files or directories. It lets you set the user and/or group that owns a file.

Syntax - chown [options] new_owner[:new_group] file_or_directory

- new_owner: the username or user ID to become the new owner
- new_group (optional): the group name or group ID to become the new group owner
- file_or_directory: the file or directory to change ownership for

**To read and display the details of a person using variables**

**Multiplication table of any number**

![alt text](tablenano.png)

![alt text](table.png)

**Comaparing two variables**

![alt text](comparenano.png)

![alt text](compare.png)

ðŸ”¸**Escape Characters**

Escape characters let you prevent special interpretation of characters.

Examples - \*, \$, \"

| Escape Sequence | Meaning                           | Example                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `\`             | Escape next character literally | `rm file\*.txt` deletes a file literally named `file*.txt` |
| `\\`            | Literal backslash                | `echo "C:\\Users"` outputs `C:\Users`             |
| `\n`            | Newline (in scripts or echo -e) | `echo -e "Hello\nWorld"` prints on two lines      |
| `\t`            | Tab (in scripts or echo -e)      | `echo -e "Name\tAge"` outputs a tab between words |

ðŸ”¸**Quoting**

Quoting controls how the shell interprets special characters (like $, *, !, &, etc.).

Quoting is enclosing text in single (') or double (") quotes to tell the shell to treat the enclosed characters literally or with some rules, preventing special characters (like wildcards, spaces, $, !, etc.) from being interpreted by the shell.

Examples - 'literal', "$var"

| Quote Type          | Description                                                    | Example                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Single quotes '...'  | Preserve the literal value of all characters inside. No expansion or interpretation happens. | 'file*.txt' â€” wildcard * treated literally, no matching |
| Double quotes "..."  | Preserve literal characters except $, `, and \. Variables and command substitution still work. | "file*.txt" â€” wildcard not expanded, but $VAR will be replaced |
| No quotes           | Shell interprets special characters like wildcards, variables, etc. | file*.txt â€” wildcard expanded to match files |
